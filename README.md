# CMAS
QE tutorial for Skoltech course on Computational Methods in Atomistic Simulations (CMAS) 

Course will cover both classical and modern topics of computational methods in atomistic simulations of condensed matters. We will begin from classical representations of electric and heat transport in condensed matter and will finish with modern theories covering the molecular dynamics methods coupled with density functional theory and applications of machine learning. Practical part of the course will be devoted to hands-on sessions where students will apply these theories on practice by performing calculations of real materials. This will give an entire picture of applied computational methods allowing the solution of various tasks like calculations of mechanical properties of solid-state compounds, lattice dynamics, thermal conductivity etc.
