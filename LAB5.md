## **LAB #5**
### **Mechanical properties**

This LAB work is devoted to calculations of elastic properties of materials using Density Functional Theory as impelemnted in the `Quantum ESPRESSO` program.

All required files are located in the `5.Mech` folder.

Script `get_data.sh` is for collecting data after the calculations

(一). Try to understand what is written in the scripts

(二). Why do we have such types of scripts and such type of the calculations?

(三). What output information do we obtain?
